Particle data typically originates from measurements and simulations in various fields such as life sciences or physics. Often, the particles are visualized directly, that is, by simple representations like spheres. Interactive rendering facilitates the exploration and visual analysis of the data. With increasing data set sizes in terms of particle numbers, interactive high-quality visualization is a challenging task. This is especially true for dynamic data or abstract representations that are based on the raw particle data. Our intermediate-level tutorial will cover direct particle visualization using simple glyphs as well as abstractions that are application-driven such as clustering and aggregation. It targets visualization researchers and developers who are interested in visualization techniques for large, dynamic particle-based data. We will focus on GPU-accelerated algorithms for high-performance rendering and data processing that run in real-time on modern desktop hardware as well as CPU-based visualizations that use interactive ray tracing methods for desktop and in situ application scenarios. Consequently, we will discuss the implementation of said algorithms and the required data structures to make use of the capabilities of modern graphics APIs. Furthermore, we will discuss GPU-and CPU-parallelized methods for the generation of application-dependent abstract representations.

Research studies have documented that diverse teams and companies produce better outcomes (more robust designs, more productivity, more profit). This lack of diversity in our community limits our potential. This half-day workshop seeks to address that lack by encouraging under-graduates from underrepresented groups and their allies to consider graduate study and careers in visualization.

Companies and organizations invest heavily in infrastructure for data storage and processing, but unless they are able to extract meaning from the data, the investment is a sunk cost with little reward. Visualization, as an effective means of bridging human knowledge and data to drive decisions, has gained popularity in recent years. Nonetheless, despite the amount of effort being put forth by the community, it is still nontrivial for scientists and practitioners to quickly create actionable visualizations with data at scale that are also reusable and beneficial in the long-term. To narrow this gap, we present a series of hands-on tutorials distilled from inter-/ external workshops. We start by introducing a “primitive-instancing-layering” (PIL) paradigm for architecting visualizations, followed by an overview of a set of open-source frameworks sharing the same design concept. We then showcase real-world examples distilled from our day-to-day work covering both geospatial and non-geospatial use cases, together with lessons learned from developing data-heavy visual analytics tools in an enterprise setting. Finally, we incorporate a deep dive into advanced topics on layer customization and performance optimizations for more advanced use cases. In the course of the tutorial, we expect the attendees to become acquainted with patterns on how to architect a visualization, and to be able to quickly prototype and verify ideas leveraging these open-source frameworks. We believe the hands-on experiences together with the best practices from an industry perspective will complement the IEEE VIS Tutorials, which are often structured in favor for academic scenarios. We also envision that our tutorial will benefit both researchers and practitioners providing building blocks to jump-start their projects and will bring in more people to contribute to the visualization community." data-room="VIS | Room 106-ABC" data-title="Large-scale Web-based Visual Analytics Made Easy" data-chat1="You have to attend this talk.
